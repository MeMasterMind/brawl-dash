**MODS ARE PC ONLY!!!!!!**

1. Download one of the mods

2. Go to the following path:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Brawl Dash\Brawl Dash_Data

3. Paste the downloaded file here and click "replace" when you get a pop up

4. Open up your Brawl Dash!

# List of all mods:

1. LeanMod\
   changes basically everything to purple / lean colour

2. JanetMod\
   puts a new brawler called Janet into the game

These mods might not work anymore since the game got updated and so did the assets, they will most likely break your game lol
